   = note: Entry structs created by the `#[metrics]` macro implement `InflectableEntry` rather than `Entry`, and need to be rooted via `RootEntry`
   = help: the following other types implement trait `metrique::writer::Entry`:
             &T
             Arc<T>
             BTreeMap<K, V>
             Box<T>
             BoxEntry
             Cow<'_, T>
             EmptyEntry
             EnumMapEntry<E>
           and $N others
