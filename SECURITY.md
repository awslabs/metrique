## Reporting Security Issues

We take all security reports seriously. When we receive such reports, we will investigate and subsequently address.

If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/). Please do **not** create a public github issue.
