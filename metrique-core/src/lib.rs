/// using a [`NameStyle`]. This defines the interface for metric *sources*
/// that want to be able to generate metric structs that can be renamed
/// without having any string operations happen at runtime.
///
/// Both `InflectableEntry` and [`Entry`] are intended to be "pure" structs - all
/// references to channels, counters and the like are expected to be resolved when
/// creating the `InflectableEntry`.
///
/// An `InflectableEntry` with any specific set of type parameters is equivalent to an
/// [`Entry`]. It should be wrapped by a wrapper that implements [`Entry`] and delegates
/// to it with a particular set of type parameters, for example `RootEntry`, and then
/// emitting that to an [`EntrySink`].
///
/// The normal way of generating a metric entry is by starting with a struct
/// that implements [`CloseEntry`] (that is generally generated
/// using the `#[metrics]` macro), wrapping it in a `RootEntry` to generate an
/// [`Entry`], and then emitting that to an entry sink.
///
/// Design note: in theory you could have a world where `InflectableEntry`
/// and [`Entry`] are the same trait (where the sinks use the default type parameters).
/// In practice, it is desired that the trait [`Entry`] will have very few breaking
/// changes since it needs to be identical throughout a program that wants to emit
/// metrics to a single destination, and therefore `InflectableEntry` is kept separate.
///
/// ## Manual Implementations
///
/// Currently, there is no (stable) non-macro way of generating an [`InflectableEntry`]
/// that actually inflects names. If you want to make a manual entry, it is recommended
/// to implement the [`Entry`] trait, then use a field with `#[metrics(flatten_entry)]`
/// as follows - though note that this will ignore inflections:
///
/// ```
/// use metrique::unit_of_work::metrics;
/// use metrique::writer::{Entry, EntryWriter};
///
/// struct MyCustomEntry;
///
/// impl Entry for MyCustomEntry {
///     fn write<'a>(&'a self, writer: &mut impl EntryWriter<'a>) {
///         writer.value("custom", "custom");
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[metrics]
/// struct MyMetric {
///     #[metrics(flatten_entry, no_close)]
///     field: MyCustomEntry,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`Entry`]: metrique_writer_core::Entry
/// [`NameStyle`]: namestyle::NameStyle
/// [`Entry`]: metrique_writer_core::Entry
/// [`EntrySink`]: metrique_writer_core::EntrySink
pub trait InflectableEntry<NS: namestyle::NameStyle = namestyle::Identity> {
